# useLayoutEffect in chat history

From my [chat file](../../components/chat.tsx) in ChatDisplay component.
I used react `useLayoutEffect` in chat scrolling function, to ensure a slightly better user experience.

You can learn [useEffect vs useLayoutEffect from Kent C. Dodds blog post](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/useeffect-vs-uselayouteffect). He provided a clear in-detail explanation there.
